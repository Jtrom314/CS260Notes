# CS 260 Notes Part II
General Notes for CS260 for use on the midterm

# Jusification for actions:
Professor Jensen (Discord CS 260 Help; General; 02/17/2023) View message here:

"Your start up README.md should be a big repository of everything you are discovering and want to record. Put whatever you would like in there. The midterm is 60 multiple choice questions covering the Console, Internet, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No time limit. Make sure you come to the in-person review on March 6th, 3 PM (JKB 3108). That should set you up for success."

Since there weren't any follow up messages placing restrictions on what could be contained in our NOTES.md file, although accessing links placed on the README file were forbidden, I have taken the liberty to take full advantage of the opportunity at hand by placing what I found to be the most useful information in this extremely long document. Enjoy :)

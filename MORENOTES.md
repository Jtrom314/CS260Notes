Professor Jensen (Discord CS 260 Help; General; 02/17/2023) [View message here:] (https://discord.com/channels/748656649287368704/748656649287368708/1076153677422788628)

"Your start up README.md should be a big repository of everything you are discovering and want to record. Put whatever you would like in there. The midterm is 60 multiple choice questions covering the Console, Internet, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No time limit. Make sure you come to the in-person review on March 6th, 3 PM (JKB 3108). That should set you up for success."

Since there weren't any follow up messages placing restrictions on what could be contained in our NOTES.md file, although accessing links placed on the README file were forbidden, I have taken the liberty to take full advantage of the opportunity at hand by placing what I found to be the most useful information in this extremely long document. Enjoy :)

# URL

ðŸ“– **Suggested reading**: [MDN What is a URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_URL)

The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) represents the location of a web resource. A web resource can be anything, such as a web page, font, image, video stream, database record, or JSON object. It can also be completely ephemeral, such as a visitation counter, or gaming session.

Looking at the different parts of a URL is a good way to understand what it represents. Here is an example URL that represents the summary of accepted CS 260 BYU students that is accessible using secure HTTP.

```js
https://byu.edu:443/cs/260/student?filter=accepted#summary
```

The URL syntax uses the following convention. Notice the delimiting punctuation between the parts of the URL. Most parts of the URL are optional. The only ones that are required are the scheme, and the domain name.

```yaml
<scheme>://<domain name>:<port>/<path>?<parameters>#<anchor>
```
Example: 
https://cs260.click:443/api/city?q=pro#3

| Part        | Example                              | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Scheme      | https                                | The protocol required to ask for the resource. For web applications, this is usually HTTPS. But it could be any internet protocol such as FTP or MAILTO.                                                                                                                            |
| Domain name | byu.edu                              | The domain name that owns the resource represented by the URL.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Port        | 3000                                 | The port specifies the numbered network port used to connect to the domain server. Lower number ports are reserved for common internet protocols, higher number ports can be used for any purpose. The default port is 80 if the scheme is HTTP, or 443 if the scheme is HTTPS.     |
| Path        | /school/byu/user/8014                | The path to the resource on the domain. The resource does not have to physically be located on the file system with this path. It can be a logical path representing endpoint parameters, a database table, or an object schema.                                                    |
| Parameters  | filter=names&highlight=intro,summary | The parameters represent a list of key value pairs. Usually it provides additional qualifiers on the resource represented by the path. This might be a filter on the returned resource or how to highlight the resource. The parameters are also sometimes called the query string. |
| Anchor      | summary                              | The anchor usually represents an sub-location in the resource. For HTML pages this represents a request for the browser to automatically scroll to the element with an ID that matches the anchor. The anchor is also sometimes called the hash, or fragment ID.                    |

Technically you can also provide a user name and password before the domain name. This was used historically to authenticate access, but for security reasons this is deprecated. However, you will still see this convention for URLs that represent database connection strings.

## URL, URN, and URI

You will sometimes hear the use of URN or URI when talking about web resources. A Uniform Resource Name (URN) is a unique resource name that does not specify location information. For example, a book URN might be `urn:isbn:10,0765350386`. A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a general resource identifier that could refer to either a URL and URN. With web programming you are almost always talking about URLs and therefore you should not use the more general URI.


# Ports

When you connect to a device on the internet you need both an IP address and a numbered port. Port numbers allow a single device to support multiple protocols (e.g. HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, or SSH) as well as different types of services (e.g. search, document, or authentication). The ports may be exposed externally, or they may only be used internally on the device. For example, the HTTPS port (443) might allow the world to connect, the SSH port (22) might only allow computers at your school, and a service defined port (say 3000) may only allow access to processes running on the device.

The internet governing body, IANA, defines the standard usage for port numbers. Ports from 0 to 1023 represent standard protocols. Generally a web service should avoid these ports unless it is providing the protocol represented by the standard. Ports from 1024 to 49151 represent ports that have been assigned to requesting entities. However, it is very common for these ports to be used by services running internally on a device. Ports from 49152 to 65535 are considered dynamic and are used to create dynamic connections to a device. [Here](https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml) is the link to IANA's registry.

Here is a list of common port numbers that you will might come across.

| Port | Protocol                                                                                           |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 20   | File Transfer Protocol (FTP) for data transfer                                                     |
| 22   | Secure Shell (SSH) for connecting to remote devices                                                |
| 25   | Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) for sending email                                             |
| 53   | Domain Name System (DNS) for looking up IP addresses                                               |
| 80   | Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) for web requests                                                |
| 110  | Post Office Protocol (POP3) for retrieving email                                                   |
| 123  | Network Time Protocol (NTP) for managing time                                                      |
| 161  | Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) for managing network devices such as routers or printers |
| 194  | Internet Relay Chat (IRC) for chatting                                                             |
| 443  | HTTP Secure (HTTPS) for secure web requests                                                        |

## Your ports

As an example of how ports are used we can look at your web server. When you built your web server you externally exposed port 22 so that you could use SSH to open a remote console on the server, port 443 for secure HTTP communication, and port 80 for unsecure HTTP communication.

![Ports](webServicesPorts.jpg)

Your web service, Caddy, is listening on ports 80 and 443. When Caddy gets a request on port 80, it automatically redirects the request to port 443 so that a secure connection is used. When Caddy gets a request on port 443 it examines the path provided in the HTTP request (as defined by the URL) and if the path matches a static file, it reads the file off disk and returns it. If the HTTP path matches one of the definitions it has for a gateway service, Caddy makes a connection on that service's port (e.g. 3000 or 4000) and passes the request to the service.

Internally on your web server, you can have as many web services running as you would like. However, you must make sure that each one uses a different port to communicate on. You run your Simon service on port 3000 and therefore **cannot** use port 3000 for your start up service. Instead you use port 4000 for your start up service. It does not matter what high range port you use. It only matters that you are consistent and that they are only used by one service.

# HTTP

ðŸ“– **Suggested reading**: [MDN An overview of HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview)

HTTP is how the web talks. When a web browser makes a request to a web server it does it using the HTTP protocol. In previous instruction we discussed how to use HTTP. Now, we will talk about the internals of HTTP. Just like becoming fluent in a foreign language make a visit to another country more enjoyable, understanding how to speak HTTP helps you communicate effectively when talking on the web.

When a web client (e.g. a web browser) and a web server talk they exchange HTTP requests and responses. The browser will make an HTTP request and the server will generate an HTTP response. You can see the HTTP exchange by using the browser's debugger or by using a console tool like Curl. For example, in your console you can use curl to make the following request.

```sh
curl -v -s http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Helping.html
```

### Request

The HTTP request for the above command would look like the following.

```http
GET /hypertext/WWW/Helping.html HTTP/1.1
Host: info.cern.ch
Accept: text/html
```

An HTTP request has this general syntax.

```yaml
<verb> <url path, parameters, anchor> <version>
[<header key: value>]*
[

  <body>
]
```

The first line of the HTTP request contains the `verb` of the request, followed by the path, parameters, and anchor of the URL, and finally the version of HTTP being used. The following lines are optional headers that are defined by key value pairs. After the headers you have an optional body. The body start is delimited from the headers with two new lines.

In the above example, we are asking to `GET` a resource found at the path `/hypertext/WWW/Helping.html`. The version used by the request is `HTTP/1.1`. This is followed by two headers. The first specifies the requested host (i.e. domain name). The second specifies what type of resources the client will accept. The resource type is always a [MIME type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types) as defined by internet governing body IANA. In this case we are asking for HTML.

### Response

The response to the above request looks like this.

```yaml
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Tue, 06 Dec 2022 21:54:42 GMT
Server: Apache
Last-Modified: Thu, 29 Oct 1992 11:15:20 GMT
ETag: "5f0-28f29422b8200"
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 1520
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html

<TITLE>Helping -- /WWW</TITLE>
<NEXTID 7>
<H1>How can I help?</H1>There are lots of ways you can help if you are interested in seeing
the <A NAME=4 HREF=TheProject.html>web</A> grow and be even more useful...
```

An HTTP response has the following syntax.

```yaml
<version> <status code> <status string>
[<header key: value>]*
[

  <body>
]
```

You can see that the response syntax is similar to the request syntax. The major difference is that the first line represents the version and the status of the response.

Understanding the meaning of the common HTTP verbs, status codes, and headers is important for you to understand, as you will use them in developing a web application. Take some time to internalize the following common values.

## Verbs

There are several verbs that describe what the HTTP request is asking for. The list below only describes the most common ones.

| Verb    | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET     | Get the requested resource. This can represent a request to get a single resource or a resource representing a list of resources.                                                                                                                        |
| POST    | Create a new resource. The body of the request contains the resource. The response should include a unique ID of the newly created resource.                                                                                                             |
| PUT     | Update a resource. Either the URL path, HTTP header, or body must contain the unique ID of the resource being updated. The body of the request should contain the updated resource. The body of the response may contain the resulting updated resource. |
| DELETE  | Delete a resource. Either the URL path or HTTP header must contain the unique ID of the resource to delete.                                                                                                                                              |
| OPTIONS | Get metadata about a resource. Usually only HTTP headers are returned. The resource itself is not returned.                                                                                                                                              |

## Status codes

It is important that you use the standard HTTP status codes in your HTTP responses so that the client of a request can know how to interpret the response. The codes are partitioned into five blocks.

- 1xx - Informational.
- 2xx - Success.
- 3xx - Redirect to some other location, or that the previously cached resource is still valid.
- 4xx - Client errors. The request is invalid.
- 5xx - Server errors. The request cannot be satisfied due to an error on the server.

Within those ranges here are some of the more common codes. See the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) for a full description of status codes.

| Code | Text                                                                                 | Meaning                                                                                                                           |

## Headers

ðŸ“– **Suggested reading**: [MDN HTTP headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers)

HTTP headers specify metadata about a request or response. This includes things like how to handle security, caching, data formats, and cookies. Some common headers that you will use include the following.

| Header                      | Example                              | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                        |

## Body

The format of the body of an HTTP request or response is defined by the `Content-Type` header. For example, it may be HTML text (text/html), a binary image format (image/png), JSON (application/json), or JavaScript (text/javascript). A client may specify what formats it accepts using the `accept` header.

## Cookies

![Cookie](webServicesCookie.png)

ðŸ“– **Suggested reading**: [MDN Using HTTP cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies)

HTTP itself is stateless. This means that one HTTP request does not know anything about a previous or future request. However, that does not mean that a server or client cannot track state across requests. One common method for tracking state is the `cookie`. Cookies are generated by a server and passed to the client as an HTTP header.

```http
HTTP/2 200
Set-Cookie: myAppCookie=tasty; SameSite=Strict; Secure; HttpOnly
```

The client then caches the cookie and returns it as an HTTP header back to the server on subsequent requests.

```http
HTTP/2 200
Cookie: myAppCookie=tasty
```

This allows the server to remember things like the language preference of the user, or the user's authentication credentials. A server can also use cookies to track, and share, everything that a user does. However, there is nothing inherently evil about cookies, the problem comes from web applications that use them as a means to violate a user's privacy or inappropriately monetize their data.

## HTTP Versions

HTTP continually evolves in order to increase performance and support new types of applications. You can read about the evolution of HTTP on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Evolution_of_HTTP).

| Year | Version | Features                                        |
| ---- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 1990 | HTTP0.9 | one line, no versions, only get                 |
| 1996 | HTTP1   | get/post, header, status codes, content-type    |
| 1997 | HTTP1.1 | put/patch/delete/options, persistent connection |
| 2015 | HTTP2   | multiplex, server push, binary representation   |
| 2022 | HTTP3   | QUIC for transport protocol, always encrypted   |

# SOP and CORS

ðŸ“– **Suggested reading**:

- [MDN Same origin policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy)
- [MDN Cross origin resource sharing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS)

Security should always be on your mind when you are working with the web. The ability to provide services to a global audience makes the information on the web very valuable, and therefore an attractive target for nefarious parties. When website architecture and browser clients were still in their infancy they allowed JavaScript to make requests from one domain while displaying a website from a different domain. These are called cross-origin requests.

Consider the following example. An attacker sends out an email with a link to a hacker website (`byu.iinstructure.com`) that is similar to the real course website. Notice the additional `i`. If the hacker website could request anything from the real website then it could make itself appear and act just like the real education website. All it would have to do is request images, html, and login endpoints from the course's website and display the results on the hacker website. This would give the hacker access to everything the user did.

To combat this problem the `Same Origin Policy` (SOP) was created. Simply stated SOP only allows JavaScript to make requests to a domain if it is the same domain that the user is currently viewing. A request from `byu.iinstructure.com` for service endpoints that are made to `byu.instructure.com` would fail because the domains do not match. This provides significant security, but it also introduces complications when building web applications. For example, if you want build a service that any web application can use it would also violate the SOP and fail. In order to address this, the concept of Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) was invented.

CORS allows the client (e.g. browser) to specify the origin of a request and then let the server respond with what origins are allowed. The server may say that all origins are allowed, for example if they are a general purpose image provider, or only a specific origin is allowed, for example if they are a bank's authentication service. If the server doesn't specify what origin is allowed then the browser assumes that it must be the same origin.

Going back to our hacker example, the HTTP request from the hacker site (`byu.iinstructure.com`) to the course's authentication service (`byu.instructure.com`) would look like the following.

```http
GET /api/auth/login HTTP/2
Host: byu.instructure.com
Origin: https://byu.iinstructure.com
```

In response the banking website would return:

```http
HTTP/2 200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://byu.instructure.com
```

The browser would then see that the actual origin of the request does not match the allowed origin and so the browser blocks the response and generates an error.

Notice that with CORS, it is the browser that is protecting the user from accessing the banking website's authentication endpoint from the wrong origin. CORS is only meant to alert the user that something nefarious is being attempted. A hacker can still proxy requests through their own server to the banking website and completely ignore the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header. Therefore the banking website needs to implement its own precautions to stop a hacker for using its services inappropriately.

## Using third party services

When you make requests to your own web services you are always on the same origin and so you will not violate the SOP. However, if you want to make requests to a different domain than the one your web application is hosted on, then you need to make sure that domain allows requests as defined by the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header it returns. For example, if I have JavaScript in my web application loaded from `cs260.click` that makes a fetch request for an image from the website `i.picsum.photos` the browser will fail the request with an HTTP status code of 403 and an error message that CORS has blocked the request.

![CORS](webServicesCors.jpg)

That happens because `i.picsum.photos` does not return an `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header. Without a header the browser assumes that all requests must be made from the same origin.

If your web application instead makes a service request to `icanhazdadjoke.com` to get a joke, that request will succeed because `icanhazdadjoke.com` returns an `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header with a value of `*` meaning that any origin can make requests to this service.

```http
HTTP/2 200
access-control-allow-origin: *

Did you hear about the bread factory burning down? They say the business is toast.
```

This would have also succeeded if the HTTP header had explicitly listed your web application domain. For example, if you make your request from the origin `cs260.click` the following response would also satisfy CORS.

```http
HTTP/2 200
access-control-allow-origin: https://cs260.click

Iâ€™ll tell you something about German sausages, theyâ€™re the wurst
```

This all means that you need to test the services you want to use before you include them in your application. Make sure they are responding with `*` or your calling origin. If they do not then you will not be able to use them.

# Fetch

ðŸ”‘ **Recommended reading**: [MDN Using the Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)

The ability to make HTTP requests from JavaScript is one of the main technologies that changed the web from static content pages (Web 1.0) to one of web applications (Web 2.0) that fully interact with the user. Microsoft introduced the first API for making HTTP requests from JavaScript with the [XMLHttpRequest API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest).

Today, the [fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) is the preferred way to make HTTP requests. The `fetch` function is built into the browser's JavaScript runtime. This means you can call it from JavaScript code running in a browser.

The basic usage of fetch takes a URL and returns a promise. The promise `then` function takes a callback function that is asynchronously called when the requested URL content is obtained. If the returned content is of type `application/json` you can use the `json` function on the response object to convert it to a JavaScript object.

The following example makes a fetch request to get and display an inspirational quote.

```js
fetch('https://api.quotable.io/random')
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((jsonResponse) => {
    console.log(jsonResponse);
  });
```

**Response**

```js
{
  content: 'Never put off till tomorrow what you can do today.',
  author: 'Thomas Jefferson',
};
```

To do a POST request you populate the options parameter with the HTTP method and headers.

```js
fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    title: 'test title',
    body: 'test body',
    userId: 1,
  }),
  headers: {
    'Content-type': 'application/json; charset=UTF-8',
  },
})
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((jsonResponse) => {
    console.log(jsonResponse);
  });
```

# Service design

Web services provide the interactive functionality of your web application. They commonly authenticate users, track their session state, provide, store, and analyze data, connect peers, and aggregate user information. Making your web service easy to use, performant, and extensible are factors that determine the success of your application. A good design will result in increased productivity, satisfied users, and lower processing costs.

## Model and sequence diagrams

When first considering your service design it is helpful to model the application's primary objects and the interactions of the objects. You should attempt to stay as close to the model that is in your user's mind as possible. Avoid introducing a model that focusing on programming constructs and infrastructure. For example, a chat program should model participants, conversations, and messages. It should not model user devices, network connections, and data blobs.

Once you have defined your primary objects you can create sequence diagrams that show how the objects interact with each other. This will help clarify your model and define the necessary endpoints. You can use a simple tool like [SequenceDiagram.org](https://sequencediagram.org/index.html#initialData=C4S2BsFMAIGEAsCGxqIA5oFCcQY2APYBO0AguCLpDvsdAEIEBG25lkAtAHwDKkRAN34AuPikQDEIcIiZRMjJtz6CRY1JOmz5igDy6OHFUKLC2VDVJlzq5yPsPGRDZpa03Md5fxOjgiIhRcAgA7EwBnZBBQ6AB3MHgXFj0DIx8RWFCIqJiiSABHAFdIcJQQglAAM0ockIVmb1VTUlwqNBQ7aGCw-kjQUPqlXnTTHkQAT2gAIgAJSHBwAinoQjIKKkwnIm47YVn5xeXKogIAWySgA) to create and share diagrams.

## Leveraging HTTP

Web services are usually provided over HTTP, and so HTTP greatly influences the design of the service. The HTTP verbs such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE often mirror the designed actions of a web service. For example, a web service for managing comments might list the comments (GET), create a comment (POST), update a comment (PUT), and delete a comment (DELETE). Likewise, the MIME content types defined by IANA are a natural fit for defining the types of content that you want to provide (e.g. HTML, PNG, MP3, and MP4). The goal is to leverage those technologies as much as possible so that you don't have to recreate the functionality they provide and instead take advantage of the significant networking infrastructure built up around HTTP. This includes caching servers that increase your performance, edge servers that bring your content closer, and replication servers that provide redundant copies of your content and make your application more resilient to network failures.

## Endpoints

A web service is usually divided up into multiple service endpoints. Each endpoint provides a single functional purpose. All of the criteria that you would apply to creating well designed code functions also applies when exposing service endpoints.

<img src='webServicesHTTPEndpoints.jpg' width=400 />

âš  Note that service endpoints are often called an Application Programming Interface (API). This is a throwback to old desktop applications and the programming interfaces that they exposed. Sometimes the term API refers to the entire collection of endpoints, and sometimes it is used to refer to a single endpoint.

Here are some things you should consider when designing your service's endpoints.

- **Grammatical** - With HTTP everything is a resource (think noun or object). You act on the resource with an HTTP verb. For example, you might have an order resource that is contained in a store resource. You then create, get, update, and delete order resources on the store resource.
- **Readable** - The resource you are referencing with an HTTP request should be clearly readable in the URL path. For example, an order resource might contain the path to both the order and store where the order resource resides: `/store/provo/order/28502`. This makes it easier to remember how to use the endpoint because it is human readable.
- **Discoverable** - As you expose resources that contain other resources you can provide the endpoints for the aggregated resources. This makes it so someone using your endpoints only needs to remember the top level endpoint and then they can discover everything else. For example, if you have a store endpoint that returns information about a store you can include an endpoint for working with a store in the response.

  ```http
  GET /store/provo  HTTP/2
  ```

  ```json
  {
    "id": "provo",
    "address": "Cougar blvd",
    "orders": "https://cs260.click/store/provo/orders",
    "employees": "https://cs260.click/store/provo/employees"
  }
  ```

- **Compatible** - When you build your endpoints you want to make it so that you can add new functionality without breaking existing clients. Usually this means that the clients of your service endpoints should ignore anything that they don't understand. Consider the two following JSON response versions.

  **Version 1**

  ```js
  {
    "name": "John Taylor"
  }
  ```

  **Version 2**

  ```js
  {
    "name": "John Taylor",
    "givenName": "John",
    "familyName": "Taylor"
  }
  ```

  By adding a new representation of the `name` field, you provide new functionality for clients that know how to use the new fields without harming older clients that ignore the new fields and simply use the old representation. This is all done without officially versioning the endpoint.

  If you are fortunate enough to be able to control all of your client code you can mark the `name` field as depreciated and in a future version remove it once all of the clients have upgraded. Usually you want to keep compatibility with at least one previous version of the endpoint so that there is enough time for all of the clients to migrate before compatibility is removed.

- **Simple** - Keeping your endpoints focused on the primary resources of your application helps to avoid the temptation to add endpoints that duplicate or create parallel access to primary resources. It is very helpful to write some simple class and sequence diagrams that outline your primary resources before you begin coding. These resources should focus on the actual resources of the system you are modeling. They should not focus on the data structure or devices used to host the resources. There should only be one way to act on a resource. Endpoints should only do one thing.

- **Documented** - The [Open API Specification](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html) is a good example of tooling that helps create, use, and maintain documentation of your service endpoints. It is highly suggested that you make use of such tools in order to provide client libraries for your endpoints and a sandbox for experimentation. Creating an initial draft of your endpoint documentation before you begin coding will help you mentally clarify your design and produce a better final result. Providing access to your endpoint documentation along with your production system helps with client implementations and facilitates easier maintenance of the service. The [Swagger Petstore](https://petstore.swagger.io/) example documentation is a reasonable example to follow.

There are many models for exposing endpoints. We will consider three common ones, RPC, REST, and GraphQL.

## RPC

Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) expose service endpoints as simple function calls. When RPC is used over HTTP it usually just leverages the POST HTTP verb. The actual verb and subject of the function call is represented by the function name. For example, `deleteOrder` or `updateOrder`. The name of the function is either the entire path of the URL or a parameter in the POST body.

```http
POST /updateOrder HTTP/2

{"id": 2197, "date": "20220505"}
```

or

```http
POST /rpc HTTP/2

{"cmd":"updateOrder", "params":{"id": 2197, "date": "20220505"}}
```

One advantage of RPC is that it maps directly to function calls that might exist within the server. This could also be considered a disadvantage as it directly exposes the inner workings of the service, and thus creates a coupling between the endpoints and the implementation.

## REST

Representational State Transfer (REST) attempts to take advantage of the foundational principles of HTTP. This is not surprising considering the principle author of REST, Roy Fielding, was also a contributor to the HTTP specification. REST HTTP verbs always act upon a resource. Operations on a resource impact the state of the resource as it is transferred by a REST endpoint call. This allows for the caching functionality of HTTP to work optimally. For example, GET will always return the same resource until a PUT is executed on the resource. When PUT is used, the cached resource is replaced with the updated resource.

With REST the updateOrder endpoint would look like the following.

```http
PUT /order/2197 HTTP/2

{"date": "20220505"}
```

Where the proper HTTP verb is used and the URL path uniquely identifies the resource. These seem like small differences, but maximizing HTTP pays dividends by making it easy for HTTP infrastructure, such as caching, to work properly.

There are several other pieces of [Fielding's dissertation](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm) on REST, such as hypermedia, that are often quoted as being required for a truly "restful" implementation, and these are just as often ignored.

## GraphQL

GraphQL focuses on the manipulation of data instead of a function call (RPC) or a resource (REST). The heart of GraphQL is a query that specifies the desired data and how it should be joined and filtered. GraphQL was developed to address frustration concerning the massive number of REST, or RPC calls, that a web application client needed to make in order to support even a simple UI widget.

Instead of making a call for getting a store, and then a bunch of calls for getting the store's orders and employees, GraphQL would send a single query that would request all of that information in one big JSON response. The server would examine the query, join the desired data, and then filter out anything that was not wanted.

Here is an example GraphQL query.

```graphql
query {
  getOrder(id: "2197") {
    orders(filter: { date: { allofterms: "20220505" } }) {
      store
      description
      orderedBy
    }
  }
}
```

GraphQL helps to remove a lot of the logic for parsing endpoints and mapping requests to specific resources. Basically in GraphQL there is only one endpoint. The query endpoint.

The downside of that flexibility is that the client now has significant power to consume resources on the server. There is no clear boundary on what, how much, or how complicated the aggregation of data is. It also is difficult for the server to implement authorization rights to data as they have to be baked into the data schema. However, there are standards for how to define a complex schema. Common GraphQL packages provide support for schema implementations along with database adaptors for query support.
